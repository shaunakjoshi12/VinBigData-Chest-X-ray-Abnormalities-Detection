# VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection

This was a kaggle competition in which I had trained an object detection model on chest X-rays for detecting several medical conditions. There were 14 types of abnormalities found in the chest Xray. The task was to localize and classify these anomalies.
I had participated individually and my rank was 1072 out of 1275 teams.
